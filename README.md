# Malware Classification Project

This repository contains the code and resources for the malware classification project. The original Big2015 dataset can be found on Kaggle: [Big2015 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/malware-classification).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/AJXGY/Malware-Classification.git
   cd Malware-Classification
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Generate asm_data.csv

To generate the `asm_data.csv` file from the asm files, run the following command:

```sh
python TF/asm_data.py
```

This will process the asm files and create a CSV file with relevant data for further analysis.

### Generate Images

To generate images from the asm data:

1. Run the `tf.py` script to prepare the data:

   ```sh
   python TF/tf.py
   ```

2. Run the `generate_png.py` script to generate images:

   ```sh
   python byte_png/generate_png.py
   ```

### Divide Dataset

To divide the dataset into training and testing sets, run:

```sh
python Big2015/divide.py
```

This will split the data and prepare it for model training and validation.

### Train Model

To train the model and save the weights to the `model_weight` directory, use the following command:

```sh
python our_model/train.py
```

### Validate Model

To load the weights and validate the model, run:

```sh
python our_model/pre_model.py
```

This will use the pre-trained weights to evaluate the model performance on the validation set.

### Compare Models

To run comparison experiments with different models, execute:

```sh
python compare_model/[model_comparison_script].py
```

Replace `[model_comparison_script]` with the actual script name you want to run for model comparison.
